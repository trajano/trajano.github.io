				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I did update the <a href="https://github.com/trajano/jaxws-maven-connector">jaxws-maven-connector</a> plugin to work with the current versions of jaxws-maven-plugin and Eclipse, as it was abandoned by the original author, I was thinking I could just get Eclipse to use the ones that are available on the official m2e discovery.

I have cross-posted the solution to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20528558/242042">stack overflow</a>  as well.</p>
<p>The idea is to use buildhelper to load up the generated files, but only execute it on m2e and set the jaxws plugin to execute on m2e.</p>
<p>Here is an example POM.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Curam out of the box comes with the <code>build database</code> functionality.  Though it is create for development, almost every single project I have been on never used it past development because it destroys data.</p>
<p>Although it isn&#8217;t possible to use build database effectively when there are structural changes, you can keep yourself sane with the reference data changes which may happen quite frequently.<br />
<span id="more-29"></span></p>
<p>In order to do this, you need to define a set of tables that are meant as reference data that comes part of the application that is separate from the transactional data that gets built at run-time.</p>
<p>I would also recommend that you DO NOT try to buy into the Curam sales pitch that says you would be able to change organization structure, security, codetable or workflow on live systems, because they are generally tied with the application and allowing operations to change this is a VERY BAD idea.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s an initial list of tables I would recommend to keep as part of reference data</p>
<p>* DPPROCESS<br />
* SECURITYGROUP<br />
* SECURITYGROUPSID<br />
* JOB<br />
* ORGANIZATIONSTRUCTURE<br />
* ORGANIZATIONUNIT<br />
* ORGUNITPARENTLINK<br />
* FUNCTONIDENTIFIER<br />
* RULESETINFORMATION<br />
* EVENTCLASS<br />
* EVENTTYPE<br />
* BATCHPROCDEF<br />
* BATCHPARAMDEF<br />
* BATCHPARAMDESC<br />
* SECURITYFIDSID<br />
* SECURITYIDENTIFIER<br />
* APPRESOURCE<br />
* DATASOURCESCHEMA<br />
* MODULECLASSNAME<br />
* BPOMETHODLIBRARY<br />
* PROCENACTEVTDATA<br />
* PROCENACTMENTEVT<br />
* SECURITYROLE<br />
* XSLTEMPLATE<br />
* DOCUMENTTEPLATE<br />
* GOAL<br />
* SUBGOAL<br />
* GOALSUBGOALLINK<br />
* ISSUECONFIGURATION<br />
* NICKNAME<br />
* OUTCOME<br />
* PLANITEM<br />
* PLANITEMOUTCOMELINK<br />
* PRODUCT<br />
* PRODUCTCATEGORY<br />
* PRODUCTCONCERNROLE<br />
* PRODUCTDELIVERYPATTERN<br />
* PRODUCTDELIVERYPATTERNINFO<br />
* PRODUCTEVIDENCELINK<br />
* PRODUCTRULESLINK<br />
* RATECOLUMN<br />
* RATEHEADER<br />
* RATEROW<br />
* RESOLUTIONCONFIGURATION<br />
* SERVICEOFFERING<br />
* SERVICEPLAN<br />
* SERVICEPLANGOALLINK<br />
* SUBGOAL<br />
* SUBGOALPLANITEMLINK<br />
* TEMPORALEVIDENCEAPPROVALCHECK<br />
* VERIFIABLEDATAITEM<br />
* VERIFICATIONCATEGORY<br />
* VERIFICATIONITEM<br />
* VERIFICATIONITEMUTILIZATION<br />
* VERIFICATIONREQUIREMENT<br />
* VERIFICATIONREQUIREMENTUSAGE<br />
* XSLTEMPLATEINST<br />
* TASKDEFINITION<br />
* WORKALLOCATIONFUNCTION<br />
* WORKQUEUE<br />
* EVIDENCEMETADATA<br />
* CODETABLEITEM<br />
* CODETABLEHEADER<br />
* CODETABLEHIERARCHY</p>
<p>Once you have determined your reference tables, ensure that their DMX and SQL files are located elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is best that you do this in stages because you have to ensure referential integrity of the data as you are going through the tables.  The simplest ones to start out with is the code table.</p>
<p>In your datamanager_config.xml add a new target called</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;target name=&quot;prepare-reference&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;components/custom/Data_Manager/Reference_Data/
               Handcrafted_scripts/delete_reference_data.sql&quot;
         type=&quot;sql&quot; base=&quot;basedir&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;compositetarget name=&quot;updatereference&quot;&gt;
  &lt;subtarget name=&quot;prepare-reference&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;subtarget name=&quot;codetables&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/compositetarget&gt;</pre><p></p>
<p>Create the delete_reference_data.sql with the following:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">delete from CODETABLEITEM;
delete from CODETABLEHIERARCHY;
delete from CODETABLEHEADER;</pre><p>Instead of build database use the following command</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">build insertdata -Dprm.target=updatereference</pre><p></p>
<p>This will prevent the lobmanager, ieg, etc from executing for now.  Those can be added later but your delete_reference_data.sql needs to be updated.</p>
<p>After the build there&#8217;s a file called build\datamanager\SetupDatabase.sql can can be executed on the production servers to update the code tables.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without changing the core Curam code, you can change your user for CuramServerTest by calling RMIAuthentication.setPrincipal().  However, you cannot invoke it directly, instead you need a wrapper class, in my case I called it CustomAuth.<br />
<span id="more-21"></span></p>
<p>The method needs to occur before the TransactionInfo gets created which happens on begin(), so the first part of your test should rollback(), set the principal and finally begin() again.</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">public class MyTest extends CuramServerTest {
  public MyTest(final String name) {
    super(name);
  }
  private static class CustomAuth extends RMIAuthentication {
    public CustomAuth(String username) throws RemoteException {
      super();
      setPrincipal(new CuramPrincipal(username));
    }
  }
  public void testSomethingAsCaseWorker() {
    rollback();
    new CustomAuth(&quot;caseworker&quot;);
    begin();
    // do the rest of the test here.
  }
}</pre><p></p>
<p>The reason I used an internal class rather than a separate class for CustomAuth is to prevent changing the CuramServerTest framework which will execute all the java files.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After hunting around for information on how the Curam product and financial components work, I still find it a bit hard to grasp.  So to help keep my sanity I am documenting some scenarios of what happens.  Hopefully other people can document other scenarios as comments to help others.<br />
<span id="more-79"></span></p>
<h2>Capturing Manual Payment</h2>
<p>When capturing a manual payment, it has to be associate with a product delivery case.  When the product delivery is activated and payments are generated, it will create a payment containing the difference between what was already paid and what is not.</p>
<h2>Financial Components</h2>
<p>Financial components are created on product delivery activation.  It actually creates it until the expected end date or certification period.</p>
<p>On activation, the deferred process actually runs an assessment for each date that matches the delivery frequency pattern. This prevents the rules from being executed every day which can take a long while.</p>
<h2>Overpayment and Underpayment Cases</h2>
<p>It seems that Overpayment and Underpayment cases are only generated when the product is <strong>certifiable</strong>.  This is done by a batch process.  The cases get created when there is a change in evidence that is applied and the batch process is run.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081227175113/http://www.trajano.net/2007/10/disabling-back-button-in-curam.html">disabling the back button</a>, even if it is one of the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-top-ten-web-design-mistakes-of-1999/">10 ten web design mistakes</a>.  However, for Cúram applications and most web other applications, this is something that would really need to be done in order to ensure that the user gets the most current data when they look at a page and to satisfy the requirement of <b>nothing persisted on the client machine</b>.</p>
<h2>Technical overview</h2>
<p>There are two things that need to be done.  The first is to add the following lines to the HTTP header:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0</pre><p>And the following in the &lt;head&gt; block of your web page.</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Expires&quot; content=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Cache-Control&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot; /&gt;</pre><p></p>
<p>This will make <strong>most</strong> web browsers not cache the page.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to do is to work around the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222064/en-us">Internet Explorer bug</a> which disregards the no-cache header information if your page is larger than 64k.  To do that add</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;NO-CACHE&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</pre><p></p>
<p>Near the end of your file.</p>
<h2>Curam implementation</h2>
<p>Unlike the process of disabling the back button, you cannot simply make the changes on <em>gen-page-header.xsl </em>or <em>gen-page-footer.xsl</em>.  The changes need to be directly done on <em>CuramCDEJ\lib\curam\xml\xsl\gen-jsp.xsl</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If there are any upgrades to Curam, the changes need to be redone on the file.</p>
<p>In <em>gen-page-header.xsl</em>, add the following XML after the first instance of &lt;head&gt; in the jsp.xsl</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;jsp:scriptlet&gt;
response.setHeader(&quot;Cache-Control&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot;);
response.setHeader(&quot;Pragma&quot;, &quot;no-cache&quot;);
response.setHeader(&quot;Expires&quot;, &quot;0&quot;);
&lt;/jsp:scriptlet&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Expires&quot; content=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Cache-Control&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot; /&gt;</pre><p></p>
<p>You also need to add the following XML after the scriptlet that outputs <strong>&lt;/body&gt;</strong>:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Expires&quot; content=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Cache-Control&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot; /&gt;</pre><p></p>
<h2>Browser compatibility</h2>
<p>This has only been tested on Firefox and Internet Explorer 6, but it should work with most browsers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing webservices in Curam is quite easy now that they are using Axis 1.2 which can parse more WSDL files. It is not the latest yet, but so far the WSDLs that are generated for a .Net environment do work in Java. I never bothered with the .cat file generation, I don&#8217;t think it works too well especially with complex WSDLs. Fortunately, we do not need them.<br />
<span id="more-126"></span><br />
As per the DocCenter, you just need to copy the WSDL files into the wsdl folder in custom and reference them in <code>webservices_config.xml</code>. When you do <code>build generated</code>, it will eventually create a <em>wsc-proxy.jar</em> file for you. The problem is that the generated Java files are not put into the <code>.classpath</code>. To fix this, add </p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;lib&quot; path=&quot;build/svr/wsc/jav&quot; sourcepath=&quot;build/svr/wsc/jav&quot;/&gt;</pre><p></p>
<p> to your <code>.classpath</code>. Do not add <code>wsc-proxy.jar</code> as Eclipse (with CheckStyle) might lock it and you cannot build without quitting Eclipse first. Now if you have an issue where you have two classes with the same name but in different packages or namespaces then you&#8217;d have a problem. Curam OOTB forces the package to &#8220;wsconnector&#8221; though I am not sure why yet. To fix this, you need to change <em>CuramSDEJ\bin\wsdl2java.xsl</em> and comment out the following line</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;xsl:attribute name=&quot;package&quot;&gt;wsconnector&lt;/xsl:attribute&gt;</pre><p></p>
<p>That should fix that problem. Until you try to do a build on CruiseControl. CruiseControl uses Ant which normally does not actually change your OS directory. So where in it tries to figure out where the NStoPkg.properties file is it might not find it. To fix this open up <code>app_wsconnector.xml</code> and add the bolded text to the following code snippet</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">name=&quot;wsdl2java&quot; classname=&quot;curam.util.tools.wsdl.WsdlToJavaAntTask&quot; classpath=&quot;${jar.tools}:${jar.axis}:${jar.wsdl4j}: ${jar.jaxrpc}:${jar.commonslogging}:${jar.commonsdiscovery}: ${jar.saaj}:${jar.j2ee}&lt;b&gt;:${SERVER_DIR}&lt;/b&gt;&quot;</pre><p> </p>
<p>${basedir} will actually point to EJBServer during the CruiseControl build.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t used much of the new Rails-type development kits yet. However, if I have to choose amongst them, I would be choosing <a href="http://trails.codehaus.org/">Trails</a> (which is now known as <a href="http://tynamo.org/">Tynamo)</a>.<br />
<span id="more-56"></span></p>
<p>The main problem with Grails (and Rails) is you are adding a new language to the mix. If all you have are highly skilled developers and not planning to do Global Resourcing then that&#8217;s all cool. However, if you are building an application with a lot of use cases, its best to rely on as little changes to the development environment as possible. It is better to move your top developers off to new customers rather than repeating drudgery with each use case (you get cheaper GR resources for that). The problems with Ruby on Rails &#8230; I&#8217;ve seen presentations and demonstrations of Rails and for the most part it is a great sell for those who are keen enough to learn new tools. Having a smaller LoC metric is good and all, but just because you can reduce something into a single line does not imply that it is generally readable.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve done many shell and Perl one liners when I need to get things done but it does not mean I would really want to subject anyone to what I&#8217;ve written.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I would be sold and would probably use Rails if I needed to get something out quickly and don&#8217;t expect people to manage what I write. That hasn&#8217;t happened for a while, most of the applications I tend to build is part of a large team and not a solo flight. It may change sooner than later because they have relatively good <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dltk/">Ruby IDE support</a> now. What critical things haven&#8217;t I seen with RoR (and why they are important).</p>
<ul>
<li>XA transaction support. I need to be a bit more specific with this one, as most people think that XA only involves databases. XA can support different resource types such as message queues and enterprise connectors. For the most part, in order to communicate with some legacy systems, a JMS type system may be needed. The message transport tends to be part of a larger transaction which may involve database activity as well.</li>
<li>Attribute oriented web page development (like Tapestry). The only way that I have seen HTML customization done in the demonstrations I&#8217;ve seen are through RHTML. RHTML is basically HTML with Ruby code (shades of model-1 JSPs and old ASP pages). RHTML, JSP, ASP or ASP.Net pages are usually not viewable by the browser. I alluded to when I talked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929232356/http://www.trajano.net/2005/10/my-ideal-web-project.html">my ideal web project</a>. Although I hear there is an add-on for this.</li>
<li>I18n support. Being in Canada we have two official languages English and French. So if you have to develop applications for the government or companies that deal with Quebec, you bet i18n support is important. Although I hear there is an add on for this too.</li>
<li>Single sign-on. This is more the JAAS thing. If you&#8217;ve been in the industry long enough, you would have heard &#8220;How many times must we do the logon use case?&#8221; quite often. Although I have an extenstion to that which is &#8220;How many times must we do the user management use case?&#8221; Personally having to do that again isn&#8217;t my idea of fun, and I&#8217;d rather delegate that to a product like Tivoli Identity Manager which I just get someone to customize the screens and leave all the backend user management stuff to the product. If you have a large enough project, you would probably save more money buying the product rather than waiting for it to be reimplemented again for your application.</li>
<li>Database migration. From what I saw with Rails, updates to the database tables are done manually by the Ruby developer. This would be quite a chore if there is a large number of table updates that need to be done. Hibernate provides Java developers with &#8220;schema-update&#8221; which generates the SQL needed to migrate existing database tables as needed (though you should still get your DBA to review it).</li>
</ul>
<p>So with the exception of Tapestry and Hibernate, the JEE environment already provides us with the necessary infrastructure out of the box. One key thing that Rails has over Java language solutions is the on the hot code change support. That may ween a lot of people over, myself included. But, I like to have as much of the infrastructure done for me when I do work and I would like to delegate work out to experts as needed. Much ado about Grails &#8230; So far my experience with Grails has been limited to just some well done <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929232356/http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRAILS/Grails+Screencasts">screencasts</a>. However, most of it was quite a bore (not because of the presenter, he did a really good job), but because it looks the same just replace Rails with Grails and Ruby with Groovy. So as far as innovation goes it does not really help much. As I was perusing through the screencasts, I found some things that I didn&#8217;t really like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch file/ant based application generation. After using Maven for a while, I haven&#8217;t found a better way of structuring your source files than they did. It may be overkill, but at least it works well (with the exception of web content). An older version of Trails did this as well, thankfully they outgrew that and moved to Maven.</li>
<li>Groovy Server Pages (GSP) It looks a lot like JSP files, which I would avoid because it cannot be sent back to the web development team once the Java guys put in all their tags and what not.</li>
<li>Groovy Yet another programming language.</li>
<li>Batch file to create new domain object. Rather than just creating a new class.</li>
<li>Ant based build targets. Rather than leveraging more standard targets we have a new set of targets to deal with. This could easily be fixed by moving the development to Maven.</li>
<li>I have to enter the domain class twice? Not sure why.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Rails, Grails support the on the hot code change support. Since Grails runs on top of a JEE stack, that may ween a lot more people over, myself included. However, it is not without its warts which I have listed above. So why Trails? Trails, although it is still in its infancy, is better geared for application development with a larger team and multiple roles (i.e., web developer, application developer) and can more easily leverage existing skills of Java developers. Here are the things that Trails has it going for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maven integration. This means dependency management, builds and project layouts are more consistent. You also get the standard site reports as you need without having to deal with a lot of low level Ant.</li>
<li>A smaller code base. Because it seems to delegate a lot of its work to other opensource packages like Tapestry and Spring rather than reinventing the wheel.</li>
<li>Tapestry. So we can utilize web developers with their Dreamweaver or whatever other tool more effectively rather than forcing them to use a JSP editor which may not offer them enough artistic flexibility.</li>
<li>Hibernate. So we get &#8220;schema-update&#8221;</li>
<li>JEE based. So we get i18n and XA out of the box rather than an afterthought.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, &#8230; Trails is far from perfect Trails is the only one I have worked with the longest among the three so I do have some issues with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not too many users. I think a good indication of this is the activity on the Trails IRC channel. I am usually the only one there when I go on.</li>
<li>Their web site does not render correctly in Internet Explorer. I normally use Firefox, but there are still a number of people that are using Internet Explorer. Having their side navigation going all the way down to the bottom of the page does not look very professional.</li>
<li>No update on their website since September 7, 2006</li>
<li>They use Maven, but their website seems to be hand coded HTML. Rather than using something like a Mavenized report. Yes it may look more plain, but at least it is consistent. It took me a bit to figure out what the subversion URL is.</li>
<li>No hot code replace. Not really possible you need to regenerate and compile every time as well. This would make things go slower and slower as your application grows.</li>
<li>An updated presentation. Trails used to have a 12 minute presentation that shows a many to many relationship. Someone needs to update this presentation. Maybe I&#8217;ll do that myself if I have to present Trails to my peers.</li>
</ul>
