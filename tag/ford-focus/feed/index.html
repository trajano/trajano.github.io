				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently leased a new 2014 Ford Focus and I have to say I love the car.  In fact I gave pretty good reviews about the car itself to <a href="http://www.maritzarg.com/ca">Martiz Research</a> even if I did give the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/east-court-ford-lincoln-sales-ltd-scarborough#hrid:OInHf_RmhxsF9P1hCrII9A">East Court Ford dealership a bad review on Yelp</a>.<br />
<span id="more-138"></span><br />
My first experience with that model was at the show room while waiting for my 2000 Ford Focus to be repaired. In response to my wife&#8217;s query of how is it? It feels like home.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning to get another Ford vehicle so I can try the field. BMW Subaru and Toyota. They were okay but none of them felt as nice and hugging compared to the focus.</p>
<p>When I ordered by car I had it pretty much customized to my specs. Blue candy color, cloth seats and sync my touch system. They had to custom build it because there was no factory model like it. Not too many people have cloth seats with the top of the line options. I don&#8217;t like leather seats. It reminds me of ordering French Fries without salt at McDonalds in order for them to make a fresh batch.</p>
<p>The SYNCsystem is the best voice recognition system I have ever used in that it can understand 90% of what I say unlike Google Now or Siri.Â  I also liked that this was the first car media player I have used that supports Japanese characters.</p>
<p>The handling has two modes. D for normal driving and S to convert myself into a Honda driver where the car gets perkier. Though I love driving on S mode when I can, I usually just keep it on D.</p>
<p>Active park assist helps in saving me money when I have to go downtown because i am parking challenged and this allows me to avail of the cheaper parallel parking spots.</p>
<p>The rear view camera and guides help me reverse park with more confidence. So much so that I reverse parking significantly more than I did with my old Ford Focus.</p>
<p>Mind you I hadn&#8217;t had a new car for 13 years. So I haven&#8217;t availed of new common place technologies that I am falling in love with now like rear view camera and sonar.</p>
<p>I also liked the remote starter for this god awful winter temperatures this year.</p>
<p>I like how climate control had improved compared to my old Cadillac where I wished I had manual control and got manual control on my old Focus. I didn&#8217;t have the option for manual on my car but I didn&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p>The touch screen as I have seen in other cars isn&#8217;t responsive. However, the voice command is good enough that I don&#8217;t look at the touch screen much. I also like that the next turn appears on my dash.</p>
<p>The bad.</p>
<p>Gas consumption is lousy for city. However I am comparing against hybrids. At least until I get a job that takes me to long drives seeing the 11L/100km just annoys me. Mind you I get relatively the same amount in my old car.</p>
<p>The car gets jumpy when moving at slow speeds. Seems like the gear timings are a bit off. Will talk to the mechanic about it when it is due.</p>
<p>The sync system though it is the best I have used still has a few flaws. Most notably is the traffic and weather uses Sirius Travel link and it is very US centric. Not to mention I think Sirius is a waste of money. I am listening to about five channels there but most of the songs I can just get from my home mp3 collection anyway.</p>
<p>Overall I will likely not keep the car after the lease is over unlike my old Focus. The SYNC system just feels a bit of a turn off and the fuel consumption is still too high.</p>
