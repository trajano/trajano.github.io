				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are reading this, you are using electricity at one point when your device is plugged into the wall.  In a sense you are using a utility, the electric company, that provides a resource for you, electricity, <strong>remotely</strong>.  Behind that wall socket is a vastly complex infrastructure that deals with providing and billing you for the electricity.</p>
<p>So how does that relate to cloud computing?  Quite a bit.</p>

<p>Cloud computing provides <strong>consumable computing resources </strong>which are information, storage or processing power.  It is important to not that it has to be <strong>consumable</strong> by a consumer otherwise it does not provide any useful benefit.  It also needs to be a <strong>computing resource</strong>, network bandwidth and electricity are not computing resources because they are not computed, but they are needed just like wires are for electricity.</p>
<p>The consumer must be able to obtain the resource <strong>remotely and with ease</strong>.  Just like a wall socket which hides all the wiring and conversions from coal, nuclear, solar, wind, etc. a web browser or app hides all the underlying complexity of the servers and networks including security and billing concerns.  Although it may seem second nature for technical people, these systems use a <strong>complex infrastructure</strong>.</p>
<h2>So where does <strong>cloud </strong>come from?</h2>
<p><em>Laziness</em>.  When technical folk do network diagrams, we usually draw the Internet as a cloud because it is a vastly complex infrastructure and generally we don&#8217;t care about it the details, only in its existence.  Except for the network diagrams it&#8217;s more of a network connection to the outside world which isn&#8217;t really a <strong>consumable computing resource</strong> much like electricity is not a <strong>consumable computing resource</strong>.</p>
<h2>So what&#8217;s the advantage of cloud computing?</h2>
<p>The main advantage of cloud computing is <strong>economies of scale</strong>.  By simplifying access to the consumable computing resources, cloud providers can expand their market to make up the cost of producing the resources gets reduced the larger the consuming market is.  As such it can be used to support the <a href="http://www.trajano.net/2013/04/trajanos-hierarchy-of-organizational-goals/">sustainability and growth goals</a> for the provider.</p>
<p>The provider traditionally is outside the organization, just like the electric company to most organizations unless you&#8217;re the electric company.  This brings us to the second advantage, <strong>predictable costs for service</strong>.  Since most providers would provide a service level agreement for a specific payment, it makes things easier to budget for organizations to use cloud services.</p>
<p>Generally <strong>simpler access to the resources </strong>than dealing with the complexity of doing it in-house, this is how the providers remain competitive.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the disadvantage?</h2>
<p>Loss of control of the computing resources.  For some organizations, privacy requirements would remove the case for using public cloud services.  However, it does not impede on developing a private cloud within the organization in order to control the information.</p>
<p>An internal cloud simplifies IT project development within the organization as the IT infrastructure complexity for consumable computing resources can be simplified to an internal cloud, reducing the need for dealing with low level computing resources by IT projects and instead focus on the business needs.</p>
<h2>In shortâ€¦</h2>
<blockquote><p>Cloud computing is a <strong>complex infrastructure that provides consumable computing resources remotely and with ease.</strong></p>
