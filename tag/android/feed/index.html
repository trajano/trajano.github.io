				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since someone told me to <i>put my money where my mouth is</i>, I finally got myself off the Android platform to replace my unsupported-after-less-than-two-years Galaxy Nexus which replaced a POS known as the Motorola XT720 and got myself an iPhone now that Wind Mobile is supported.  In a quick nutshell, I am happy with the move.<br />
<span id="more-71"></span></p>
<p>The battery life of the phone is ridiculously long compared to my Galaxy Nexus (4 hours usage + 22 hours standby vs 16hour standby only on the Galaxy Nexus).  Then again an iPhone 3GS can last quite long already and my friends who have the iPhone 4S and 5 can have their phone on standby past a day.  Yes, I can do the same with my Android by rooting and putting in Greenify and using Titanium Backup to wipe out some system apps, but at least with the iPhone, I don&#8217;t have to do any of that.</p>
<p>The size is perfect for my hand, I can type with just my right thumb.  Phones are getting larger and larger, even my Galaxy Nexus was too large to type with one hand.  I have to rely on replacement keyboards like SwiftKey to make my experience bearable.</p>
<p>The physical home key which Nexus devices do not have because some engineer in Google thought physical buttons are passe.  I really want my button there so I know when I have pressed it.  The Samsung Active series which has physical buttons would be perfect, but the Nexus devices don&#8217;t have them in the current releases.</p>
<p>The iPhone is not without its flaws though.  Being on iOS 7 was a major flaw for the product, the OS changes and some functionality loss it introduced since iOS6 were pretty much inexcusable.</p>
<p>* The date selector is actually much slower now that they grouped day and month together.  At the very least they kept the time selection relatively intact unlike the Google Calendar time selector which reminds me of those stereo volume controls Apple used to have.</p>
<p>* The lack of a distinct button shape which they copied from Android is a step in the wrong direction for UX.  How does one tell that a button is a button?  At least they&#8217;re fixing it on 7.1</p>
<p>* The default weather app no longer shows the current temperature on the icon.</p>
<p>* The maps app is very unintuitive to use and like Google&#8217;s Maps app can&#8217;t remember you want to avoid toll roads.  At least I won&#8217;t be too frustrated with this now that I have the SYNC with Navigation on my new Ford Focus.</p>
<p>* Bluetooth car stereo controls are not really intuitive (same with Android, but Android has an app for fixing up the screw you Google did to those with car stereos).</p>
<p>* The phone app like Google&#8217;s phone app does not link to the keypad directly.  It also does not support T9 entry which Google finally added in 4.4.</p>
<p>Along with the move I lost a few things, which so far I don&#8217;t miss:</p>
<p>* Customization of the home screen.  I&#8217;ve used the stock launch, alternate launchers based on stock and Launcher 7.  Of all the launchers, I liked Launcher 7 in terms of UI, but near the end of my phone&#8217;s life, I went with stock just because I wanted to suffer through the Google experience (e.g. dragging an app icon to the top of the screen to uninstall it).  Seriously, why bother?</p>
<p>* Rooting and customization of the OS.  Ya I&#8217;ve done that, I&#8217;ve even compiled and deployed my own kernel to see if I can introduce some changes.  However, is it worth the effort just to get the soft buttons in an order I want? Not more than the 30 times I have done it.  Maybe the CyanogenMOD phone will fix all those stupid issues in AOSP, but for now it does not exist yet.</p>
<p>The only thing I do miss:</p>
<p>* I can&#8217;t program for iOS.  XCode is still the shits compared to Eclipse.  Also the $99/year fee to put my own program in my own phone is retarded.  At least I have an Android tablet for that.</p>
<p>Considering the price that was paid, it feels heavy like the One Ring.  However, it was a choice of being pissed off with another BULKY Android phone for a couple more years or being somewhat happier for four years (based on the experience I had with my friend&#8217;s iPhone 3GS which I would be using right now if it could work with Wind Mobile).</p>
