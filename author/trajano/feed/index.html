				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the moment site.trajano.net is being hosted on 000webhost. Though I don&#8217;t recommend webhost for anything where you don&#8217;t have the original publishing source, it is still a good cheap public site to try out HTML and PHP experiments. Github Pages would be a nice to have because it should be more stable though it is primarily static. Since Maven sites are just static content, it shouldn&#8217;t be too bad to deal with.<br />
<span id="more-135"></span></p>
<p>The problem I have with doing this is the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21520904/multi-module-example-of-using-mvn-site-deploy-with-github-pages">lack of proper example for publishing via SCM</a> which I have posted a question on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>So I was thinking I can publish to a  directory that is local or an internal site which is tied to github pages and push up the changes when I am satisfied.</p>

<span id="more-152"></span><br />
This means SEI-CMM level 3 requirement for organizational level tools is something I don&#8217;t recommend for delivery (it still makes sense for the enterprise though).</p>
<p>A few examples are using git for managing the work and delivery to the enterprise, but ensure the final source code prior to release outside of delivery is in Rational Team Concert where enterprise controls are well established.</p>
<p>Another example is using JIRA Agile to managing agile projects,  but still use something like Remedy to manage tickets on the enterprise level.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My view is an enterprise needs to be sustainable and your architecture is only as sustainable as the least supported component.  My view for delivery is different, but that&#8217;s another story.<br />
<span id="more-148"></span></p>
<p>I was recently pondering this when I was working on my <a href="http://github.com/trajano/trajano-logo">logo</a> which depended on <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/batik-maven-plugin/">batik-maven-plugin</a> which hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2009.  Of course I took it as a calculated risk, especially since I can code <a href="https://github.com/trajano/batik-maven-plugin">my own batik-maven-plugin</a>.  Imagining this if it were an enterprise that relied on an open source component that suddently didn&#8217;t get any more support.</p>
<p>Open source does have support partners, but can it handle your company?  Technology tends to come and go like fashion trends and when interest wanes, the support wanes or becomes more expensive (just like the cost of extended support for XP).</p>
<p>The good part is  at least two large vendors: IBM and Oracle provide support for their products that are based on open source software so at least you&#8217;re going to be better covered.</p>
<p>If someone asks me whether I would use MySQL or Ruby on Rails, and Git vs DB2, WebSphere and Rational Team Concert, I would go for the later set.</p>
<ol>
<li>There&#8217;s a single BIG vendor that owns the product that simplifies the support costs.  Though you&#8217;re reliant on them so it better be a big vendor that you won&#8217;t worry about going belly up anytime soon.</li>
<li>Having a vendor to support you allows you to pass the onus of fixing bugs to the vendor rather than getting and keeping the skills in-house which would cost more in the future or you&#8217;d get someone stuck that doesn&#8217;t grow anyway.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently leased a new 2014 Ford Focus and I have to say I love the car.  In fact I gave pretty good reviews about the car itself to <a href="http://www.maritzarg.com/ca">Martiz Research</a> even if I did give the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/east-court-ford-lincoln-sales-ltd-scarborough#hrid:OInHf_RmhxsF9P1hCrII9A">East Court Ford dealership a bad review on Yelp</a>.<br />
<span id="more-138"></span><br />
My first experience with that model was at the show room while waiting for my 2000 Ford Focus to be repaired. In response to my wife&#8217;s query of how is it? It feels like home.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning to get another Ford vehicle so I can try the field. BMW Subaru and Toyota. They were okay but none of them felt as nice and hugging compared to the focus.</p>
<p>When I ordered by car I had it pretty much customized to my specs. Blue candy color, cloth seats and sync my touch system. They had to custom build it because there was no factory model like it. Not too many people have cloth seats with the top of the line options. I don&#8217;t like leather seats. It reminds me of ordering French Fries without salt at McDonalds in order for them to make a fresh batch.</p>
<p>The SYNCsystem is the best voice recognition system I have ever used in that it can understand 90% of what I say unlike Google Now or Siri.  I also liked that this was the first car media player I have used that supports Japanese characters.</p>
<p>The handling has two modes. D for normal driving and S to convert myself into a Honda driver where the car gets perkier. Though I love driving on S mode when I can, I usually just keep it on D.</p>
<p>Active park assist helps in saving me money when I have to go downtown because i am parking challenged and this allows me to avail of the cheaper parallel parking spots.</p>
<p>The rear view camera and guides help me reverse park with more confidence. So much so that I reverse parking significantly more than I did with my old Ford Focus.</p>
<p>Mind you I hadn&#8217;t had a new car for 13 years. So I haven&#8217;t availed of new common place technologies that I am falling in love with now like rear view camera and sonar.</p>
<p>I also liked the remote starter for this god awful winter temperatures this year.</p>
<p>I like how climate control had improved compared to my old Cadillac where I wished I had manual control and got manual control on my old Focus. I didn&#8217;t have the option for manual on my car but I didn&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p>The touch screen as I have seen in other cars isn&#8217;t responsive. However, the voice command is good enough that I don&#8217;t look at the touch screen much. I also like that the next turn appears on my dash.</p>
<p>The bad.</p>
<p>Gas consumption is lousy for city. However I am comparing against hybrids. At least until I get a job that takes me to long drives seeing the 11L/100km just annoys me. Mind you I get relatively the same amount in my old car.</p>
<p>The car gets jumpy when moving at slow speeds. Seems like the gear timings are a bit off. Will talk to the mechanic about it when it is due.</p>
<p>The sync system though it is the best I have used still has a few flaws. Most notably is the traffic and weather uses Sirius Travel link and it is very US centric. Not to mention I think Sirius is a waste of money. I am listening to about five channels there but most of the songs I can just get from my home mp3 collection anyway.</p>
<p>Overall I will likely not keep the car after the lease is over unlike my old Focus. The SYNC system just feels a bit of a turn off and the fuel consumption is still too high.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I leased two cars for my family&#8217;s use. I would summarize my experience with five different dealerships. </p>
<p>Markham Subaru<br />
Scarborough Subaru<br />
Don Valley Toyota<br />
Richmond Hill BMW<br />
East Court Ford Lincoln</p>
<p>The gist is this.<br />
When I start I am not sure what to get yet. So demonstrate the cars to me. </p>
<p>I usually indicate my pain points namely parking. Don&#8217;t dismiss my pain points and say just get practice. </p>
<p>When I have an idea what I want I want to be able to try similar cars. Don&#8217;t make it too difficult for me to test drive other cars.</p>
<p>I want the best deal possible without the act of going to manager for approval. If you can&#8217;t give me a good rate and need approval then send me directly to the one who can rather than waste my time. </p>
<p>I want all the possible charges laid out in front and show me the final number rather than surprise more fees.</p>
<p>Also you tell me the price and we will work from there. Not the other way around.</p>
<p>The experience</p>
<p>Richmond Hill BMW, Scarborough Subaru and Markham Subaru did just that at least most of it. Markham Subaru won the SUV sale just because the location was more convenient and because the Subaru Forrester was the better car.  Though the sales experience had a few minor glitches in the experience. Scarborough Subaru had the best experience just the location wasn&#8217;t as good as the Markham one. </p>
<p>Now for my own car which had to be a sedan wasn&#8217;t as smooth an experience. Toyota did the dance around with the sales and manager that it was such a turn off and the Prius was a terrible car the year I was test driving. Ford was the same but they had a better car that just said BUY ME. So in the end Ford won the sale for my car but because of the car rather than the sales experience. Also I stuck with that dealership because I have been with their service center for over 13 years with my last car and I like to keep the relationship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since someone told me to <i>put my money where my mouth is</i>, I finally got myself off the Android platform to replace my unsupported-after-less-than-two-years Galaxy Nexus which replaced a POS known as the Motorola XT720 and got myself an iPhone now that Wind Mobile is supported.  In a quick nutshell, I am happy with the move.<br />
<span id="more-71"></span></p>
<p>The battery life of the phone is ridiculously long compared to my Galaxy Nexus (4 hours usage + 22 hours standby vs 16hour standby only on the Galaxy Nexus).  Then again an iPhone 3GS can last quite long already and my friends who have the iPhone 4S and 5 can have their phone on standby past a day.  Yes, I can do the same with my Android by rooting and putting in Greenify and using Titanium Backup to wipe out some system apps, but at least with the iPhone, I don&#8217;t have to do any of that.</p>
<p>The size is perfect for my hand, I can type with just my right thumb.  Phones are getting larger and larger, even my Galaxy Nexus was too large to type with one hand.  I have to rely on replacement keyboards like SwiftKey to make my experience bearable.</p>
<p>The physical home key which Nexus devices do not have because some engineer in Google thought physical buttons are passe.  I really want my button there so I know when I have pressed it.  The Samsung Active series which has physical buttons would be perfect, but the Nexus devices don&#8217;t have them in the current releases.</p>
<p>The iPhone is not without its flaws though.  Being on iOS 7 was a major flaw for the product, the OS changes and some functionality loss it introduced since iOS6 were pretty much inexcusable.</p>
<p>* The date selector is actually much slower now that they grouped day and month together.  At the very least they kept the time selection relatively intact unlike the Google Calendar time selector which reminds me of those stereo volume controls Apple used to have.</p>
<p>* The lack of a distinct button shape which they copied from Android is a step in the wrong direction for UX.  How does one tell that a button is a button?  At least they&#8217;re fixing it on 7.1</p>
<p>* The default weather app no longer shows the current temperature on the icon.</p>
<p>* The maps app is very unintuitive to use and like Google&#8217;s Maps app can&#8217;t remember you want to avoid toll roads.  At least I won&#8217;t be too frustrated with this now that I have the SYNC with Navigation on my new Ford Focus.</p>
<p>* Bluetooth car stereo controls are not really intuitive (same with Android, but Android has an app for fixing up the screw you Google did to those with car stereos).</p>
<p>* The phone app like Google&#8217;s phone app does not link to the keypad directly.  It also does not support T9 entry which Google finally added in 4.4.</p>
<p>Along with the move I lost a few things, which so far I don&#8217;t miss:</p>
<p>* Customization of the home screen.  I&#8217;ve used the stock launch, alternate launchers based on stock and Launcher 7.  Of all the launchers, I liked Launcher 7 in terms of UI, but near the end of my phone&#8217;s life, I went with stock just because I wanted to suffer through the Google experience (e.g. dragging an app icon to the top of the screen to uninstall it).  Seriously, why bother?</p>
<p>* Rooting and customization of the OS.  Ya I&#8217;ve done that, I&#8217;ve even compiled and deployed my own kernel to see if I can introduce some changes.  However, is it worth the effort just to get the soft buttons in an order I want? Not more than the 30 times I have done it.  Maybe the CyanogenMOD phone will fix all those stupid issues in AOSP, but for now it does not exist yet.</p>
<p>The only thing I do miss:</p>
<p>* I can&#8217;t program for iOS.  XCode is still the shits compared to Eclipse.  Also the $99/year fee to put my own program in my own phone is retarded.  At least I have an Android tablet for that.</p>
<p>Considering the price that was paid, it feels heavy like the One Ring.  However, it was a choice of being pissed off with another BULKY Android phone for a couple more years or being somewhat happier for four years (based on the experience I had with my friend&#8217;s iPhone 3GS which I would be using right now if it could work with Wind Mobile).</p>

I have cross-posted the solution to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20528558/242042">stack overflow</a>  as well.</p>
<p>The idea is to use buildhelper to load up the generated files, but only execute it on m2e and set the jaxws plugin to execute on m2e.</p>
